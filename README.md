  ### Overview
  >This analysis contains relevant insights from the Kickstarter Challenge dataset, to inform the readers with solid arguments and allow them to make better planning decitions. 
  
  ### Outcomes based on launchdates
  
  Based on launchdates analysis succesful campaigns had a top performance during the month of May. It is recomndable to keep in mind June and July as high performing months. This could be related due to summer activities. 
  Succesfull campaigns represent the 60% of the years activity with 839 while failed campaigns represent the 35%. Cancelled and Live campaigns are too low to be relevant. 
  
  Failed campaigns were very stable during the whole year oscillating between 50 and 35 for the full year.

If we look at the goals vs pledged we can get a picture of which months are better in terms of revenue. 

### Other considerations 

While the whole picture at first glance would mean August is the the month with a highest rate of money pldged.(Img.1GoalvsPledged)

The reality is that 2014 had an outstanding play that pledged $198,415.01 GBP.
There are two important things to consider here:
1. This play is an Outlier, and it is important to deep dive into this. We might get useful insights so we can replicate the same circumstances in other plays and reach higher goals. 
2. This play is a non-recurrent event and might be important to be kept isolated from the analysis. MEaning the tendencies actually point out that the top perfomring months are April, June and December as mentioned in the previous analysis. (Img.2GoalvsPledged)
